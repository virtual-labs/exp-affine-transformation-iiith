The experiments are designed in two parts:

1. Single transformation among three is allowed.
2. Multiple transformations are allowed.

**Single Transformation**

1. Select image from the mosaic using select image option
   - a. Select region of the image to load it in the input image panel.
   - b. Select appropriate parameters to see the effect.
2. Select single choice option
   - a. Only one transformation is available at a time.
   - b. Select one choice among three choices: scaling, rotation and translation.
   - c. For rotation and scaling, select interpolation function to see the difference in the output. The default choice for interpolation function is nearest neighbor.
3. Select run option to see the output under the selected parameters.

**Multiple Transformations**

1. Select multiple choice option
   - a. Order selection panel will be pop out. Select the order in which you want to perform the operation. The order sequence is displayed in front of each transformation choice. During operation, edit option is provided below in the left panel to change the selected order of operation.
   - b. All three transformations are allowed under this choice.
   - c. The interpolation function is kept fixed i.e. nearest neighbor for this operation.
2. Select appropriate parameters
   - a. In case you do not want any particular transformation. Do not change parameter of the respective choice.
3. Select the run option to perform operations
4. Output panel and intermediate results panel will display the obtained output.
